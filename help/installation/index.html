<div class="alert">
    <strong>Attention!</strong> Plugins are only supported in OctoPrint versions 1.2.0 and later, <strong>not</strong>
    the 1.1.x versions that are still included in stable OctoPi builds. In order to be able to use any of the
    plugins here you'll first need to upgrade to 1.2.0-rc1 or later if you are not running it already.

    You can find instructions on how to do so <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-update-the-octoprint-installation-on-my-octopi-image">in OctoPrint's FAQ</a>.
</div>

All plugins listed in this repository can be installed using the <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager">Plugin Manager</a>
bundled with OctoPrint or alternatively via command line.

You have these three options:

<ul>
    <li>
        Open the plugin repository in the Plugin Manager's settings dialog, find the plugin you are interesting in there
        and install it with the "Install" button provided next to it.

        <ul class="thumbnails">
            <li class="offset4 span4">
                {% capture screenie %}{% include canonic_url url='/assets/img/help/install_plugin_from_repo.png' %}{% endcapture %}
                <a href="{{ screenie }}" data-lightbox="install_from_repo" data-title="Installing a plugin from the repository">
                    <img src="{{ screenie }}" alt="Install plugin from repository" title="Installing a plugin from the repository" class="span12">
                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Copy the URL after <code>pip install</code> in the little "Installation" box that's part of every plugin page and
        paste that into the "Install from URL" text box in the Plugin Manager's settings dialog. If it also says
        <code>--process-dependency-links</code> click on "Advanced options" at the bottom of the dialog and make sure
        that the checkbox "Use --process-dependency-links with pip install" is checked. Then hit "Install".

        <ul class="thumbnails">
            <li class="span4 offset2">
                {% capture screenie %}{% include canonic_url url='/assets/img/help/install_plugin_from_url_1.png' %}{% endcapture %}
                <a href="{{ screenie }}" data-lightbox="install_from_url" data-title="Installing a plugin from URL: Where to find the URL">

                </a>
            </li>
            <li class="span4">
                {% capture screenie %}{% include canonic_url url='/assets/img/help/install_plugin_from_url_2.png' %}{% endcapture %}

                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Copy the full "Installation" command listed on each plugin page and paste it into the command line of the host
        you installed OctoPrint on. <strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you are using the correct version of <code>pip</code> -- on OctoPi you'll
        need to use <code>~/oprint/bin/pip</code> instead of just <code>pip</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
