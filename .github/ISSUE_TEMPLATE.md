READ FIRST, THEN DELETE:

What kinds of issues you should report here:

  * missing or broken homepage, source or download URLs
  * broken images
  * incorrect compatibility information
  * ... in short, anything related to the data on plugins.octoprint.org

What you should not report here:

  * Any kinds of issues with the plugins themselves - report those
    to the plugin author instead!

Thanks :)
